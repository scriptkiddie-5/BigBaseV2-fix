Strictly for educational purposes.
Updated for GTA 1.61

## Features
* Pregenerated for Visual Studio 2022

* Native return spoofing
* Access to YSC script globals

## Building
To build BigBaseV2 you need:
* Visual Studio 2022
* C++ 17 compiler (not hard to update code for C++ 20, but not needed)
* a fucking brain

Now, you will be able to open the solution, and simply build it in Visual Studio.
